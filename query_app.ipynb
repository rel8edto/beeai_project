      "200 {'answer': \"**Executive Summary**\\nA deep dive was completed for GOOGLE to review its relationships and identify foreign linkages. Using several data sources and open-source intelligence, a relationship summary has been compiled for GOOGLE’s key officers, shareholders, addresses, controversies and financial indicators, with the following key takeaways.\\n\\nSorry, I couldn’t fetch data for “Google”: \\n\\nSorry, I couldn’t fetch data for “Google”: \\n\\n**Key Shareholders**\\n\\nAs of the quarter ending 2024-12-31, the company's key shareholders are represented by 4,589 reporting institutions, collectively holding 3.2 billion shares, equivalent to a market value of $613.8 billion. These shareholders account for 26.16% of the company's total ownership. Notably, 573 new positions were established, while 2,192 existing positions were increased, indicating a significant level of confidence in the company's prospects. Conversely, 1,711 positions were reduced, and 173 were closed, suggesting some degree of profit-taking or rebalancing. The put/call ratio of 0.98 implies a slightly bearish sentiment among institutional investors, as the number of put options (betting on price decline) slightly exceeds call options (betting on price increase). Quarter-on-quarter, the number of new positions and positions increased surpassed the reductions and closures by more than 5%, underscoring the overall bullish stance of these key shareholders.\"}\n"
